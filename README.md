# Text Extractor
Author: Seth Freeman; freeman.seth086@gmail.com

This simple C++ application is able to read .txt files and populate maps representing the words, numbers, and characters, along with their frequencies, present throughout the file. File cross comparison is also a feature of this program enabling you to see which file has more of a specific instance of something you may be looking for.
Due to the program's simplicity, only local .txt files can be typed into the console for searching. In the future however, I want to use a better approach such as the Windows open file dialog to be able to load and save files from the file explorer.
Some difficulties I encountered with this project were filename checking user inputted paths, comparing two different maps from different files, and general efficiency/optimization and control flow.
